Hi! This is my 42 cursus **ft_linear_regression** project. The objective was to implement from scratch the gradient descent algorithme and use it to train our model.

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> To run the program from source, you need to have `uv` installed on your system.
> https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/

To train the model
```bash
uv run sources/train.py
```

To make predictions
```bash
uv run sources/predict.py
```

To plot the model
```bash
uv run sources/bonus.py
```
